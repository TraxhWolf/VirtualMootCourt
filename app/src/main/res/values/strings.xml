On some occasions they used to have few verbal quarrels with each other but they reconciled soon after the verbal fight. Two years after the marriage Jenny gave birth to a baby girl on 4th September 2010. The girl was named as Jennifer.  After few months of the birth of Jennifer, Jenny observed certain changes in the behaviour of Michael. Michael started behaving in a rude way and he usually becomes violent on every petty issue without any reason. Initially Jenny did not took the matter in a serious way but when the violent character of Michael continued Jenny took her husband Michael to the doctor Alfered (DW1), who was a psychiatrist. The doctor advised Michael to have control over anger and to take certain medicines. The doctor diagnosed him to be suffering from first stage of Bipolar Mood Disorder (Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. There are four basic types of bipolar disorder; all of them involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels). </string>

On dated 5th December 2010 at 11am, loud noise of fighting, crying and shouting was coming from the house of Michael. On hearing the cry Daniel(PW3) who was neighbour of Michael went in the house of Michael and found Jenny lying unconscious  on the floor pooled in blood with various injuries on her body. At that time Daniel saw Michael hiding a 7 inch Iron Axe in the garden.  Thereafter Daniel called the police and Jenny was taken to government hospital whereby she was treated by Dr. Andrew (PW2). Michael was arrested by police on the same day and was kept in police custody. On 6th December, 2010 Jenny regained her consciousness and her statement was recorded by  Jaison (PW1) SHO of  Flemingo Police Station. In her statement she told to the police that on 5th December at 10 am Michael came home and started fighting with her in a violent way and when she resisted Michael attacked him with axe kept in the garden.
